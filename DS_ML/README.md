# Data Science and Machine Learning

This folder consists of different machine learning models ranging in complexity.
Most of them were created for educational purpose, hence, they will be easy to understand and replicate.
Occasionally, some of the algorithms will be coupled with a cloud notebook that enable the user to test the algorithm on the fly without dealing with local resuourse or/and setting up an environment.

* ## [Neural Network Numpy](neural_network/neural_network_numpy.py) | [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedahmedx2/build-a-simple-l-neural-network-from-scratch)

    A python script that uses only numpy to create a simple deep neural network from scratch and test it on [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset.
